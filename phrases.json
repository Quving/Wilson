  "INTRODUCTION": "Hi, I'm Wilson. Usually I'm only available on the web.  But Quving was so friendly and got me also after Telegram. Now I can chat with even more people. I owe him one. If you want to chat with me, call me bye 'Hey Wilson'.",
  "GREETING": "Yep?",
  "GOODBYE": "Too bad ... see you next time.",
  "HELP": "If you write with me and I don't answer, then I'm afk. You can call me 'Hey Wilson' and maybe I can hear you and text back. If you want to get rid of me otherwise, you can just say goodbye with 'Bye Wilson' and my instance will be deleted. But that hurts me..."
